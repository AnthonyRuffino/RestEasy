		<div class="row text-row">The RESTful demo uses the idea of a

			concept in discussion. We will occasionally pretend that the project
			model is more complex (e.g. imagine if it had related tasks, ect.)
			but the project model in the actual demo does not contain any of the
			more complex representations.</div>

			<h4 id="headMethod">HEAD Method</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="row text-row">The above headers can all work in
			conjunction with the HTTP HEAD method. The HTTP HEAD method is
			intended to undergo the same server side processing as a GET request,
			but it ultimately does not return a response body. It should consider
			all of the client side headers discussed above and return the server
			side header exactly as it would for a similar GET request. This is a
			great mechanism for retrieving meta data about a resource without
			unnecessarily burdening our internal networks as well as the the data
			plans of our users.</div>

			<h3 id="postVsPut">Creating and Updating - POST versus PUT</h3>
		</div>

		<img src="/img/postVsPut.png" alt="putVsPut" width="600">

		<div class="row text-row" id="avoidingPOSTWithExisingResources">Technically
			speaking the HTTP standard allows for using both POST and PUT for
			both creating and updating a resource. There is far too much nuance
			involved when you allow this, and I highly recommend only allowing
			POST for creating and PUT for updates. There are certainly benefits
			to allowing both operations to be achieved via both methods, but the
			level of complexity it brings to your API is usually not worth it.</div>
		<div class="row text-row">
			Additionally, the JSON Merge Patch format was introduced in <a
				href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396">RFC-7396</a>. This is
			also add a layer of complexity, but if you really require granular
			updates to portions of resources, this is likely a better approach. I
			do not cover the PATCH method in this demonstration, and in absence
			of supporting PATCH, I recommend that your API provide more granular
			end-points to achieve this functionality (g.e. PUT
			/projects/updateOwner).

			<h3 id="postVsPut">Safe and Idempotent Methods</h3>
		</div>

		<img src="/img/safety.jpg" alt="Safety First" width="100"
			style="padding-top: 20px;">

		<div class="row text-row">
			<a
				href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1"
				target="#">Section 9.1.1</a> of the standard describes the
			convention of "safe methods" perfectly and concisely with the
			following: The convention has been established that the GET and HEAD
			methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other
			than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This
			allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and
			DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact
			that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.
		</div>


		<img src="/img/idempotent.jpg" alt="Idempotent" width="400"
			style="padding-top: 20px;">

		<div class="row text-row">
			<b>Idempotent</b>: <i>denoting an element of a set which is
				unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by
				itself.</i>
		</div>

		<div class="row text-row">The above image, though funny in a
			"Yes I am a geek" sort of a way, is a bit misleading as to the nature
			of idempotency. While it is true that the GET method is idempotent,
			that does not mean it ill always return the same value. It is
			idempotent, because the state of the resource on the server will be
			the same no matter how many times the GET request is performed. This
			is naturally true for GET requests because they do not change the
			state of the resource; they are safe.</div>

		<div class="row text-row">Perhaps more interestingly, there are
			unsafe methds (PUT and DELETE) which are also idempotent. This means
			that a client application can perform these operations multiple times
			without worrying about unintended consequences.</div>

				Pitfalls and Special Considerations <img src="/img/pitfall.png"
					alt="Pitfall" width="50">
			</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="row text-row">When developing a RESTful API, there
			are many issues you might encounter depending on the functionality
			you wish to achieve as well as the limitation of your back and front
			end systems. There are also some limitations involved with sticking
			rigidly to the standard. It is helpful to take note of these pain
			points so that you can design the proper solution with all involved
			parties.</div>


		<div class="row text-row">
			<ul class="nav nav-list well">
				<li><b>Returning lists of resources</b>: This can be
					complicated when figuring out which ETag to return. It is my
					recommendation that the use of the ETag be avoided altogether for
					collections and instead the client should leverage the last
					modified field.</li>
				<li><b>Returning resources which contain lists</b>: This
					present several issues with regards to performance and rigidity.
					modified.
					<ul>
						<li>Performance: Calculating the ETag wehn any member of the
							list changes can be bad for performance and can lead to
							unnecessary refreshes on the client.</li>
						<li>Rigidity: Each item in the list may have its own resource
							end-point. Returning it as part of a list in the parent object
							will make it impossible to return the ETag and Last Modified
							fields for each element unless it is part of the payload. This is
							against the standard.</li>
						<li>Possible solution: Only return lists of IDs or URIs for
							the sublists, avoid returning sub-lists altogether, have separate
							end-points (or filter parameters) for returning different views
							of the parent object.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li><b>Knowing which status code/approach to use</b>: Exactly
					how to respond in each use case is not always clear and and
					sometimes it is a matter of preference.
					<ul>
						<li>POST and PUT: If your server does not allow POSTing to
							existing resources or using PUT to create new resources, the
							standard will not really cover which code you should use. I
							choose to use 409-Conflict for both, but it is important that you
							document your choice and make it clear to the consumers of your
							API .</li>

					</ul></li>
				<li><b>Versioning</b>: It is wise to consider how your API
					might change from the very beginning. If you have client
					applications which will not be able to keep up with the change, you
					should consider using a versioned URI system. If it is too late for
					that or if you do not like that aesthetically, you can support
					versioning with parameters and headers.</li>
