		<div class="row text-row">The purpose of this demonstration is
			to review some common principals of the HTTP standard, and namely,
			how they can be leveraged in order to make our RESTful web
			applications faster and more efficient.</div>
		<div class="row text-row">This application also contains a
			RESTful web application written with Spring-boot which can be used in
			order to demonstrate some of the concepts discussed.</div>
		<div class="row text-row">The RESTful demo uses the idea of a
			simple project with a name and an owner. We will also reference this
			concept in discussion. We will occasionally pretend that the project
			model is more complex (e.g. imagine if it had related tasks, ect.)
			but the project model in the actual demo does not contain any of the
			more complex representations.</div>

				<li>The first thing to ask is <b>Why?</b> Why should we follow

			<h4 id="headMethod">HEAD Method</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="row text-row">The above headers can all work in
			conjunction with the HTTP HEAD method. The HTTP HEAD method is
			intended to undergo the same server side processing as a GET request,
			but it ultimately does not return a response body. It should consider
			all of the client side headers discussed above and return the server
			side header exactly as it would for a similar GET request. This is a
			great mechanism for retreiving meta data about a resource without
			unnecessarily burdening our internal networks as well as the the data
			plans of our users.</div>
